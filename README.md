# iCalc

This is a simple implementation of classic calculator in pure JS.

Design and basic logic was inspired by Calculator project from [Complete Intro to Web Development](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/) by [Brian Holt](https://github.com/btholt).

Here I implement some additional functionality:

- handle numbers with dots;
- handle negative numbers;
- handle `00`;
- add error handling for some cases (f.e., edge cases for 0 and -0);
- show current active operation.

Here`s only one commit, 'cause I wanted to have a good repo name for it ðŸ™‚

If you interested, you can find actual work on this project [here](https://github.com/lazzzaroni/JS_04.23/tree/homework_6).
